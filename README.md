The purpose of Rockhounding Chemistry is to assembly and maintain an industrial area in which several machines handle various types of ingredients (solid, fluid and gaseous) to produce advanced material for mid-late game stages. It also leads to several features, functional applications and experiments.

Each machine can be also integrated with custom recipes, allowing to freely reassess the working chain, or to use each machine on its own. The mod brings a set of machinery which can interact with eachother, working as parts of a unique factory. It also aims to involve the player in the production chain, planning how to efficiently prioritize the resources.

By default the mod features a tech tree running through the processes which bring a mined undefined mineral to be analyzed, acknowledged and treated to become chemical elements.
The goal is to acquire several elements and material by using a progressive manipulation, to turn the raw mineral into the final dust form.
